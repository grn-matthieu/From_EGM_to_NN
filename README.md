## Overview

This repository contains the code, notebooks, and results for my Master’s thesis in **computational economics**.  
The project investigates how **deep learning** methods can be useful for economists compared to traditional **perturbation** and **projection** methods.

This thesis is inspired by **Maliar et al. (2021)**. The notebooks in the repository replicate and enhance their approach. We select throughout the notebooks problems with a kink in the policy function. This attribute makes it a good stress test for numerical solution methods.

This repository aims to document the results exposed in the thesis. The graphs, tables, and results, are reproducible, as random seeds are fixed.

The Jupyter notebooks in the repository are written using the Julia Programming Language 1.11.6

External readers may feel free to use my work for personnal or educationnal purposes.
